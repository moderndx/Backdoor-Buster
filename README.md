# Backdoor-Buster

What does it do?

This will stop backdoored addons from messing with you in singleplayer or your server! It'll detect any malicious attempts to run code and will log all backdoors to my webserver incase they find a workaround! This means it'll always be ontop of every backdoor no matter what!
